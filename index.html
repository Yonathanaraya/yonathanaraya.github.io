### CPSC 120

* **Lab 10**  
  Lab 10, Part 1 was a great learning experience. I worked on calculating the populations of different counties using two-dimensional vectors. This lab helped me understand how to organize large sets of data and search through them effectively. I learned how to create functions that calculate population statistics, and after thorough testing, everything worked perfectly.

* **Lab 7**  
  Lab 7, Part 1 was a fun challenge. I created a program to determine whether street parking is allowed, based on posted signs. This lab introduced me to working with conditional statements, Boolean logic, and input validation. I gained a deeper understanding of how to structure my code and manage real-world problems with logic. The tests passed, and I felt more confident in my coding skills after completing it.

* **Lab 6**  
  Lab 6, Part 1 was one of the more difficult labs, but it was also very rewarding. I worked on programming a word game, which was a great way to practice using "if-else" statements. Although I faced many errors like formatting and linting issues, I learned a lot about debugging and resolving problems. After running all the tests and seeing everything work correctly, I was really proud of what I accomplished.
