# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is **Yonathan Araya**, and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) majoring in **Computer Science**.

## Computer Science Projects

### CPSC 120

- **Lab 10**  
  Lab 10, Part 1 was my favorite lab I worked on. I worked on calculating the populations of different counties using two-dimensional vectors. This lab helped me understand how to organize large sets of data and search through them effectively. I learned how to create functions that calculate the stats of the population of each county, and after running all tests, everything worked perfectly.

- **Lab 7**  
  Lab 7, Part 1 was pretty challenging to me. I created a program to determine whether street parking is allowed, based on posted signs. This lab introduced me to working with conditional statements like Boolean logic and input validation. I gained a deeper understanding of how to structure my code and manage real-world problems with logic. After all the tests passed, I felt more confident in my coding skills after completing it.

- **Lab 6**  
  Lab 6, Part 1 was one of the more difficult labs, but it was also very rewarding. I worked on programming a word game, which was a great way to practice using "if-else" statements. Although I faced many difficult formatting and linting errors, I learned a lot about debugging and resolving problems. After running all the tests and seeing everything passed, I was really proud of what I accomplished.

### CPSC 121

- **Lab 4**  
  Lab 4 was a great start to working with file input and output in C++. In this lab I was building a Donation Tracker stored Donor names and amounts that would read out the data back to calculate total donations. This lab taught me how to read and write to text files, and how to structure my program using classes to organize the donor information. This lab helped me become more confident in my work.

- **Lab 6**  
  Lab 6 was a little bit challenging for me at the start because I had to manage bank accounts using C++ classes and std::map. In this lab I created a program that could create, delete, and look up accounts by ID, while storing their balances securely. This lab helped me understand how to pair object-oriented programming with STL containers to manage data efficiently. This Lab also taught me the importance of organizing logic clearly when handling multiple user operations. This lab showed me that I can build more complex programs.

- **Leftover Tracker Project**  
  Leftover Tracker Project was a huge challenge for me. I had a hard time completeting this lab project because it was more complex compared to what else we did during the other labs. I was still able to complete it and was probably the biggest and projects I hacve ever completed in the labs. So basically I built a web-based app using C++ and the Crow framework to keep track of leftover food. I learned how to create and connect multiple classes to add, delete, and list food records. I also worked with JSON data and built a report system that gave suggestions for reducing food waste. This lab helped me see how everything I learned earlier in the semester could come together in a real project, and it made me feel more confident building full programs on my own.
